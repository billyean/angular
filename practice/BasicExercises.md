Before starting the exercises, it's important to carefully read this. When a particular exercise requires user input, the prompt command will be used. However, please note that the prompt-sync package needs to be installed beforehand. To do this, initiate an npm project and install the package using the following steps:
```shell
npm init
npm install prompt-sync
```

Additionally, you must add the following command in the first line in your code:
```javascript
prompt = require("prompt-sync")()
```
