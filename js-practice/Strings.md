# Exercises

1. Create a program that reads two words and concatenates them, displaying the resulting word.
2. Write a program that takes a word and displays each letter separately.
3. Create a program that takes a sentence and replaces all the letters "a" with "e".
4. Create a program that takes a sentence and replaces all spaces with a new line.
5. Write a program that receives a name and checks that it starts with the letter "A".
6. Write a program that reads a word and checks if it is a palindrome (if it can be read backwards the same way).
7. Create a program that reads two words and checks if the second word is an anagram of the first.
8. Write a program that takes a full name and displays only the first name.
9. Make a program that receives a sentence and displays the amount of blank spaces present in it.
10. Create a program that reads a word and displays the number of vowels present in it.
11. Create a program that reads a word and displays the number of vowels and consonants present in it.
12. Write a program that takes a full name and displays the last name (last name) first.
13. Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For instance, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3.
14. Write an algorithm that checks whether a word is a "primeword". 
> A word is considered a "prime word" if the sum of the letter values (where 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, etc.) is a prime number.
15. Given a list of strings, write a function to determine the longest common prefix.
