# Exercises

1. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. 
2. Implement a recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
3. Create a recursive function to check if a number is prime.
4. Develop a recursive function to calculate the sum of the digits of an integer.
5. Write a recursive function to calculate the power of an integer raised to an exponent.
6. Implement a recursive function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
7. Create a recursive function to reverse a string.
8. Develop a recursive function to find the smallest value in an array.
9. Write a recursive function to determine whether a word is a palindrome.
> A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar, the date "22/02/2022" and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama". The 19-letter Finnish word saippuakivikauppias (a soapstone vendor), is the longest single-word palindrome in everyday use, while the 12-letter term tattarrattat (from James Joyce in Ulysses) is the longest in English.
10. Implement a recursive function to calculate the sum of elements of an array.
