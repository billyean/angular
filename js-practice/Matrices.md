# Exercises

1. Write a program that fills a 3x3 matrix with values entered by the user and displays the sum of the main diagonal values.
2. Write a program that fills a 4x4 matrix with random values and displays the transposed matrix.
3. Write a program that fills a 5x5 matrix with integers and displays the largest value in the matrix and its position.
4. Count negative numbers in a matrix.
```javascript
// assume matrix is given as, you shall output 'Number of negative numbers in the matrix: 6'.
const matrix = [
  [2, -3, 5, 0],
  [-7, 8, -1, 4],
  [6, 0, -9, 10],
  [-12, -15, 17, 20]
];
```
5. Calculate the sum of boundary elements of a matrix.
```javascript
   // assume matrix is given as, you shall output 'Sum of boundary elements: 40'.
   const matrix = [
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9]
   ];
```
6. Write a program that reads a 4x4 matrix and checks if it is a diagonal matrix, that is, if all elements outside the main diagonal are equal to zero.
7. Write a program to Write a program that fills a 4x4 matrix with random numbers and displays the sum of the values present in each row and in each column.
8. Write a program that reads a 3x3 matrix and calculates the determinant of the matrix.
9. Write a program that reads two 2x2 matrices and displays the sum of the two matrices.
10. Write a program that reads two matrices and returns the multiplication between them as an answer. The program should observe whether or not it is possible to perform the multiplication between the two matrices.
11.  Print a matrix in spiral order.
12. Write a program that reads an m x n matrix, indicating the location where there are mines in a Minesweeper game (being 0 for a neutral field, and 1 for locations where there would be mines), and the program should return a matrix indicating, for each position, the number of mines in neighboring houses.
13. Make a function that receives a 3x3 matrix representing the game of tic-tac-toe, and check if there is a winner, if there is a tie, or if the game is not over yet
