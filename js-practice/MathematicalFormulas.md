3. Create a program that calculates and displays the arithmetic mean of three numbers entered by the user.
4. Write a program that reads two numbers, the first being the base and the second the exponent, and then printing the first number raised to the second.
5. Write a program that calculates the geometric mean of three numbers entered by the user → ![geometric mean](./images/image_rsrc1ZR.jpg).
6. Write a program that calculates the BMI of an individual, using the formula BMI = weight / height²
7. Create a program that calculates and displays the perimeter of a circle, prompting the user for the radius, using the formula P = 2πr
8. Write a program that calculates the area of a circle from the radius, using the formula A = πr²
9. Write a program that calculates the delta of a quadratic equation (Δ = b² - 4ac).
10. Write a program that calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle, using the formulas P = 2(w + l) and A = wl, where w is the width and l is the length.
11. Write a program that calculates the perimeter and area of a triangle, using the formulas P = a + b + c and A = (b * h) / 2, where a, b and c are the sides of the triangle and h is the height relative to the side B.
